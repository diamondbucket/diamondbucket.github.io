<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is pranav, am a teenage boy from india who is trying to be a web
  Developer there is no big reason for me aspiring to become one, i just want to
  be one because after turning 18 i realised looking at my skill sets that i had
  nothing to brag about, it was kinda like empty and boring i was like a gamme's
  main character with no stats or special skills henceforth i decided to acquire
  this skill by deticating myself and my time to learn this course and become a
  web developer despite my busy college life.

<p>
  Am good at drawing and other art works, so am interested at designing websites
  colors have always intruiged me and creating something is fun it may be cliche
  to say this but i want to be a creator. am currently exploring my
  opportunities in many fields where i could have fun creating something out of
  my work.

<p>
  am an engineering student who is specialised at mechatronics. am currently at
  my first year of my 4 year degree, life in college is different from my high
  school life wish i could get back there but time is irreversible anyways
  another field am interested in is robotics i am good at taking the first steps
  and bad at continuing it, i usually get overwhelmed and stop the work midway
  leading to inconsistency in my success rate. I am under a journey of
  learning,acquiring and mastering new skills that interest and benefit me, web
  developing swwm s to be the first serious leap for me and yup this is about my
  clumsy brain with ocd , am not sure whether i could call this a about me page
  but this surely says something about me.
